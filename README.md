arduino_NFC
===========

Library to support arduino development with NFC readers/writes.

This library includes some utilities based on the https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C library here. We've reorganized that library into 3 different includes (utilities for reading and writing data, NDEF tag encoding and NDEF tag decoding).
